# Unique Password Generator

Welcome to my **Password Generator** assignment. Below is this weeks assignment.

# Assignment Discription

I created a random password generator that ask the user to accept/decline specific criterias to generate a password.
When the user is "clicks" on the "Generate Password" button, the alert screen presents a prompt with a criteria for a password to be generated. once they accept, the user is then prompted with series of question as alerts to how they want the random password to include length, numbers, uppercase, lowercase and special characters. Once the user has has completed the questionaire, the program then randomly generates a password.
